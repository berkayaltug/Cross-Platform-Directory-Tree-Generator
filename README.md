# Cross-Platform-Directory-Tree-Generator
The `Cross-Platform Visual Directory Tree Generator` is a Python-based CLI tool designed to create a structured and visual representation of a directory tree. It recursively scans directories, counts files and folders, generates visual output, and saves the structure in `.txt`, `.json`, `.yaml`, and `.zip` formats.
